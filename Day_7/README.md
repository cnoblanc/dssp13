Alternatively you can create a new conda environment which will be called
`dssp` by default and whill contain all the packages required to run the
notebooks:

``` bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate dssp
$ jupyter notebook
```

You can also update an existing `conda` environment:


``` bash
$ conda env update -f environment.yml
```
